# TicTacToe Game 

This is a small project for TicTacToe game implementation in Python using Tkinter. 

## Gameplay

Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, cross 'X' and naught 'O', who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. Each player occupies a cell in turn. The goal is to place all three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.  

## Approach 

The code is divided in two parts. Part one contains all the functions and Part 2 the initialization:

 
#### Part 1: Functions
    1 - FUNCTION onclick_event => this event is triggered when user clicks a button
         Function to find a button by its name
         Function to set button's value (X or O)
         Function to check game over
    2 - FUNCTION getting_button_value => Returns button value/text (X or O)
    3 - FUNCTION checking_game_over  => Returns True or False
    4 - FUNCTION resetting_game => Clears all buttons text

####  Part 2: Initializing Tic Tac Toe game  

     1 - Creating and setting window properties
     2 - Creating font
     3 - Declaring initial value (X)
